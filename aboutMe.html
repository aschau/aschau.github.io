			<p class = "aboutBody" id = "howHere">My initial passion for computers was ironically sparked by the lack of knowledge about computers and the wonders of the internet when I was younger. My family was never really technology oriented and as a result while most of my peers were raving over Runescape and connecting on Myspace, I unwittingly continued to play with my Nintendo 64 and Gameboy Advance while the world kept moving. 
			 
			It wasn't until early high school that I really found out more about the beautiful world that is the internet and understood it for what it was. I started looking into how websites and applications were made which led me to learn some basic HTML and to a BASIC compiler called FreeBASIC.
			 
			While I didn't progress very far past the beginning stages of each, it was my first step into the world that is computer science and it felt as if I had just discovered fire. This eventually led me to pursue computer science as a major and resulted in my enrollment at the University of California, Irvine under Computer Game Science.

			I loved video games and the idea of creating something that I could share with the world, but I knew that it wasn't going to be as easy and wonderful of a process as it sounded. I came into UCI fully aware of what I was getting into and I have to say that I am proud of what I've achieved at this school so far.

			I know that there's still a lot for me to learn, but I plan on taking full charge of the adventure that lies ahead.</p>

			<p class = "aboutBody" id = "whereNow">I am now on my fourth year at the University of California, Irvine. I'm currently working on my senior capstone project lead by Professor Josh Tanenbaum.

			My current game project is called "Monochrome Memories" (working title) and is a puzzle platformer created in Unity using C#. It is a game that is more design and art oriented than any game I've worked on so far.

			I am also currently working as a Quality Assurance Tester at Atlus USA in Irvine. I am currently working on a SEGA title, Yakuza 0. It is my first real step into the game industry and am thoroughly enjoying my time at the company. Also, Yakuza 0 has been one of the greatest games I've ever played.

			I am currently on the job hunt for another position in the games industry whether it be game design, software engineering, or project management.
