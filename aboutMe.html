			<p class = "aboutBody" id = "whereNow">I recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Computer Game Science with a focus on Human Computer Interaction.

			<br></br>Noteworthy projects that I created during the course of my schoolwork include Scuminvaders, Spooky Spoils, Life of Py, and Monochrome Memories.

			<br></br>I am currently working at a company called Super Toy Box as a Software Developer. I am developing a VR software product that is multiplatform for Vive, Oculus, Samsung Gear VR, Android, and IOS.
			<br></br>I was previously a Quality Assurance Tester at Atlus USA in Irvine. I worked on a SEGA title, Yakuza 0. It was my first real step into the game industry and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the company. My team and manager, Scott Strichart, were great to work with and I would definitely recommend working at Atlus for quality assurance for anyone looking for jobs within the field.

			I am currently on the job hunt for another position in the games industry whether it be game design, software engineering, or project management.

			<p class = "aboutBody" id = "howHere">My initial passion for computers was ironically sparked by the lack of knowledge about computers and the wonders of the internet when I was younger. My family was never really technology oriented and as a result while most of my peers were raving over Runescape and connecting on Myspace, I unwittingly continued to play with my Nintendo 64 and Gameboy Advance while the world kept moving. 
			 
			It wasn't until early high school that I really found out more about the beautiful world that is the internet and understood it for what it was. 
			 
			<br></br>I started looking into how websites and applications were made which led me to learn some basic HTML and to a BASIC compiler called FreeBASIC. While I didn't progress very far past the beginning stages of each, it was my first step into the world that is computer science and it felt as if I had just discovered fire. This eventually led me to pursue computer science as a major and resulted in my enrollment at the University of California, Irvine under Computer Game Science.

			I loved video games and the idea of creating something that I could share with the world, but I knew that it wasn't going to be as easy and wonderful of a process as it sounded. I came into UCI fully aware of what I was getting into and I have to say that I am proud of what I've achieved at this school so far.

			I know that there's still a lot for me to learn, but I plan on taking full charge of the adventure that lies ahead.</p>
